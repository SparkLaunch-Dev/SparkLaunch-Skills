# SparkLaunch Color Palettes

Generate and inspect private brand palettes through the connected SparkLaunch app.

## Rules

<!-- sparklaunch:connection:start -->
1. Use the SparkLaunch MCP connection supplied by Claude Code. Never ask the user for credentials, access tokens, refresh tokens, or authorization headers.
2. If the SparkLaunch tools are absent, stop before planning or claiming execution and say: **SparkLaunch isn't available in this Claude Code session. Confirm that the SparkLaunch plugin is installed and enabled, run `/mcp`, and complete the SparkLaunch browser sign-in if prompted. Then reload plugins or start a new Claude Code session and send the request again.**
3. If a SparkLaunch tool returns an OAuth challenge, ask the user to authenticate or re-authenticate from `/mcp`, then retry only after the connection succeeds.
4. If authorization is expired or revoked, stop before any write and say: **Your SparkLaunch authorization is expired or revoked. Re-authenticate SparkLaunch from `/mcp`, complete the permission screen, and then retry. I will not repeat a write until the connection is restored and any uncertain prior result is checked.**
<!-- sparklaunch:connection:end -->
5. Use `projects.list` when needed, then pass the selected `project_id` to every palette tool. Use `projects.get` to confirm `effective_permissions` includes `branding.write` before generation; if required access is missing from the connection_permissions list, reconnect through the host and approve it. Explain an explicit plan or role denial using its stated remedy; do not infer that denial from effective permissions alone.
6. `branding.generate_palette` is a write and requires a stable `idempotency_key`. Do not retry with a new key after an uncertain result.
7. Use `branding.list_palettes` or `branding.get_palette` to verify saved results.
8. Retain project and palette identifiers only as internal tool-call state. Never repeat them to the user or include identifier/version labels or columns; refer to palettes by name and colors.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the business, audience, desired feeling, and any color constraints.
2. Call `branding.generate_palette` with a concrete prompt and explicit project id.
3. Present the generated options, including primary, secondary, accent, neutral-light, and neutral-dark colors.
4. Use the saved palette id in downstream planning; do not claim favorite status because the current connected tool set does not change favorites.

## Output

Report the palette name, description, creation time, and each color's hex value and feeling. State whether the result was newly generated or retrieved.
