# SparkLaunch Color Palettes

Generate and inspect private brand palettes through the connected SparkLaunch app.

## Rules

<!-- sparklaunch:connection:start -->
1. Use the standards-based OAuth connection managed by the current host. Never request or accept credentials, bearer tokens, authorization codes, client secrets, or transport headers.
2. If the required SparkLaunch actions are absent, stop before planning or claiming execution. Explain that SparkLaunch is not loaded in this session and direct the user to install or enable this package using the current host's documented flow, then start a fresh session.
3. If a loaded action returns an OAuth challenge, use the current host's documented connect or reconnect flow and retry only after the host reports success. Never use a pasted token as a fallback.
4. If authorization is expired or revoked, stop before any write, reconnect through the current host, and check the target before retrying an uncertain operation.
<!-- sparklaunch:connection:end -->
5. Use `projects.list` when needed, then pass the selected `project_id` to every palette tool. Use `projects.get` to confirm `effective_permissions` includes `branding.write` before generation; explain a plan or role limitation without requesting OAuth reconnection.
6. `branding.generate_palette` is a write and requires a stable `idempotency_key`. Do not retry with a new key after an uncertain result.
7. Use `branding.list_palettes` or `branding.get_palette` to verify saved results.
8. Retain project and palette identifiers only as internal tool-call state. Never repeat them to the user or include identifier/version labels or columns; refer to palettes by name and colors.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the business, audience, desired feeling, and any color constraints.
2. Call `branding.generate_palette` with a concrete prompt and explicit project id.
3. Present the generated options, including primary, secondary, accent, neutral-light, and neutral-dark colors.
4. Use the saved palette id in downstream planning; do not claim favorite status because the current connected tool set does not change favorites.

## Output

Report the palette name, description, creation time, and each color's hex value and feeling. State whether the result was newly generated or retrieved.
