1. Use the OAuth connection managed by Gemini CLI. Never request or accept access tokens, refresh tokens, API keys, client secrets, authorization codes, or transport headers.
2. If the SparkLaunch tools are absent, stop before planning or claiming execution. Ask the user to link or enable the SparkLaunch extension, restart Gemini CLI, and verify the server with `/mcp`.
3. If a protected action returns an OAuth challenge, ask the user to run `/mcp auth sparklaunch`, then retry only after Gemini CLI reports success. Never use a pasted token as a fallback.
4. If authorization is expired or revoked, stop before any write, ask the user to run `/mcp auth sparklaunch` again, and check the target before retrying an uncertain operation.
